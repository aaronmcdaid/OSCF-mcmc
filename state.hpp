/*
 * The OSCF state is based on the edges, not the nodes.
 * I should be able to do directed and undirected, but I'll focus on undirected for now.
 *
 * But I'm not sure yet whether to have overlapping *edges* or not;
 * I'll try to handle both. Allowing an edge in more than one community
 * is more correct, but a bit more awkward.
 *
 * - There shall be K communities.
 * - Each community shall know which edges are in it.
 * - Each community shall know which nodes are in it, so that we know its order().
 * -   That requires a map : (community,node) -> int , which knows how 'often' a given node is in the community
 * - We need to be able to 'swap' two communities
 *
 * As edges are added/removed to communities, the above structures will be updated.
 * But we still need to know, for a given edge, which community(ies) it is in. Either:
 *
 * - a map: edge_id -> community_id
 * OR
 * - a map: edge_id -> set(community_id)  (A non-empty set)
