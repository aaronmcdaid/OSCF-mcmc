   == Compiling ==

To get the latest code from github and compile:

     git clone --recursive -o github git://github.com/aaronmcdaid/vcSBM.git
     cd vcSBM
     make

   == Running ==

You can simply run it with

     ./vcsbm edge_list.txt

where edge_list.txt is your edge list file, made up of one line per edge.
Each line gives the two nodes that are connected, separated by whitespace.

By default, the network is treated as unweighted and undirected.
To use other options, run

     ./vcsbm --help

I would appreciate any feedback, and would be willing to make changes if
you have any requests.
